# Remove Adjacent Duplicate Characters

Given a string, we want to remove 2 adjacent characters that are the same, and repeat the process with the new string until we can no longer perform the operation.

Here's an example and some starter code:
```python
def remove_adjacent_dup(s):
  # Fill this in.

print(remove_adjacent_dup("cabba"))
# Start with cabba
# After remove bb: caa
# After remove aa: c
# print c
```
